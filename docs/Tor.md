# Tor (The Onion Router)

**Tor** is a free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication over the internet. It routes internet traffic through a worldwide volunteer network of relays to conceal users' location and usage. It is widely used for privacy, security, and bypassing censorship.

## üîç What can Tor do?

- Provide anonymous browsing by routing traffic through multiple layers of encryption
- Help circumvent internet censorship and surveillance
- Enable access to .onion websites (hidden services)
- Provide a SOCKS5 proxy for routing traffic from other applications
- Support onion routing for secure communications

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Usage

### Start Tor
To start Tor, you typically use the following command (assuming Tor is installed):

```
tor
```

This runs the Tor process, which listens on port 9050 by default.

### Use Tor as a SOCKS5 proxy

By default, Tor listens on `127.0.0.1:9050` for SOCKS5 traffic. You can route your applications through Tor by configuring them to use this proxy.

For example, with `curl`:
```
curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:9050 http://example.com
```

## üß∞ Common Configuration Options

| Option                         | Description                                                   |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--SocksPort`                   | Define the SOCKS port (default: 9050)                         |
| `--ControlPort`                 | Enable a control port for managing the Tor process            |
| `--DataDirectory`               | Specify where Tor stores its data (such as cache and logs)    |
| `--ExitNodes`                   | Specify exit nodes (for example, `--ExitNodes {us}`)          |
| `--EntryNodes`                  | Specify entry nodes for better control over routing           |
| `--DisableNetwork`              | Disable network connections (useful for testing or debugging)|
| `--Proxy`                       | Set a proxy for Tor to connect through                        |

## üß™ Examples

### Route traffic through Tor with curl
```
curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:9050 https://example.com
```

### Use Tor with proxychains
```
proxychains curl https://example.com
```

Make sure `proxychains.conf` is set to use `socks5 127.0.0.1 9050`.

### Use Tor with a custom exit node
```
tor --ExitNodes {us} --SocksPort 9050
```

This forces Tor to exit through an exit node in the United States.

### Tor for SSH tunneling
```
ssh -o "ProxyCommand torify nc %h %p" user@remote-host.com
```

This routes SSH traffic through Tor.
