# masscan

**masscan** is a high-performance TCP port scanner, capable of scanning the entire Internet in seconds. It‚Äôs similar to Nmap but optimized for speed, using its own asynchronous network stack.

## üîç What can masscan do?

- Scan thousands of IPs per second
- Identify open TCP ports quickly and efficiently
- Customize scan rate, output format, ports, and IP ranges
- Export results for Nmap or other tools
- Useful for reconnaissance, network mapping, and red teaming

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Usage

```bash
sudo masscan -p80 192.168.1.0/24
```

This scans port 80 across the 192.168.1.0/24 network.

## üß™ Examples

### Scan a network for open HTTP ports
```bash
sudo masscan -p80 192.168.0.0/24 --rate=1000
```

### Scan all ports on a single host
```bash
sudo masscan -p0-65535 10.0.0.1 --rate=500
```

### Output results to XML
```bash
sudo masscan -p22,80 192.168.1.0/24 -oX scan.xml
```

### Exclude specific IPs or ranges
```bash
sudo masscan -p443 0.0.0.0/0 --exclude 127.0.0.1,192.168.1.0/24
```

### Banner grabbing (limited support)
```bash
sudo masscan -p80 10.10.10.0/24 --banners
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- **masscan must be run as root** to send raw packets.
- Setting `--rate` too high on a LAN may trigger IDS/IPS or flood networks.
- It uses its own network stack; you may need to configure `--interface` and `--router-mac` manually.
- Output is compatible with tools like `nmap` or `msfconsole`.
