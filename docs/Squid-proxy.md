## üîç What can Squid do?

- Caching: Speed up web access by storing copies of frequently accessed content
- Access Control: Control and restrict user access based on IP, domain, or URL
- Proxying: Forward requests to other servers for HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP
- Bandwidth Management: Reduce bandwidth consumption through caching
- Privacy: Hide the client's IP address from the target server
- Authentication: Support for basic, digest, and NTLM authentication

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Usage

Squid typically runs as a background service and requires configuration before use.

Start Squid:
```
sudo systemctl start squid
```

The default configuration file is located at `/etc/squid/squid.conf`.

## üß™ Examples

### Basic configuration and start:
1. Install Squid:
```
sudo apt-get install squid
```

2. Edit `/etc/squid/squid.conf` to set `http_port`:
```
http_port 3128
```

3. Restart Squid:
```
sudo systemctl restart squid
```

### Allow access from specific IP:
In `squid.conf`, create an ACL:
```
acl my_network src 192.168.1.0/24
http_access allow my_network
```

### Block specific domains:
```
acl block_sites dstdomain .example.com
http_access deny block_sites
```

### Enable caching and logging:
```
cache_dir ufs /var/spool/squid 100 16 256
access_log /var/log/squid/access.log
cache_log /var/log/squid/cache.log
```
