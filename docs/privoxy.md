# Privoxy

`Privoxy` is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for enhancing privacy, modifying web page data, managing cookies, and controlling access. It works well in combination with tools like Tor or VPNs to anonymize and filter traffic.

## üîç What can Privoxy do?

- Act as a local HTTP proxy for web filtering and privacy
- Block ads, tracking scripts, and unwanted content
- Rewrite or modify HTTP headers and page content
- Work with Tor to anonymize web browsing
- Control cookie handling and site access rules
- Run as a background service or daemon

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Usage

```
sudo systemctl start privoxy
```

Configure your browser or tool (like `curl` or `httpie`) to use:

```
