## üß™ Common Use Cases

### Debug Web Traffic
- See exactly what a browser or app sends to a server
- Identify authentication issues, cookies, headers, redirects

### Penetration Testing
- Analyze API traffic for sensitive data
- Test for improper session handling, insecure cookies, etc.

### Mobile App Testing
- Route mobile device traffic through Fiddler (set device proxy)
- Inspect how mobile apps communicate over the network

### Replay or Modify Requests
- Use the Composer or AutoResponder to test various payloads

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Fiddler installs a local root certificate to decrypt HTTPS traffic; this may trigger warnings.
- Be cautious when decrypting traffic‚Äînever install the Fiddler root certificate on a production system or someone else‚Äôs device without consent.
- Not suitable for stealthy or large-scale automated capture.
