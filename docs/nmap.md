# Nmap (Network Mapper)

**Nmap** is a powerful, open-source network scanning and enumeration tool. It is widely used by system administrators and penetration testers to discover hosts, detect open ports, identify services, operating systems, and potential vulnerabilities.

## üîç What can Nmap do?

- Scan for live hosts and open ports
- Detect service versions and operating systems
- Identify firewall rules, filters, and packet behavior
- Run NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) for vulnerability scanning
- Perform stealth, aggressive, or custom scans
- Export results in multiple formats (text, XML, grepable)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Usage

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.1
```

Scans the host at 192.168.1.1 using default settings.

## üß™ Examples

### Quick scan of a subnet
```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```

### Full TCP scan with service and OS detection
```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sV -O -p- 10.0.0.1
```

### Scan multiple targets
```bash
nmap 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 example.com
```

### Run vulnerability scripts (NSE)
```bash
nmap --script vuln 192.168.0.5
```

### Output scan results to XML
```bash
nmap -oX results.xml 192.168.1.0/24
```

### Fast scan of top 1000 ports with custom rate
```bash
nmap -T4 --top-ports 1000 10.10.10.0/24
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Running some scans (like `-sS`, `-O`, or `--script`) requires root privileges.
- Using aggressive scans or NSE scripts can trigger IDS/IPS systems.
- Scanning external or third-party networks without permission is illegal in many jurisdictions.
