# iconv ‚Äì Character Encoding Converter

**iconv** is a command-line utility for converting text files between different character encodings. It's essential for handling legacy code pages, fixing broken characters, or preparing payloads in the correct format for a target system.

## üîç What Can iconv Do?

- Convert between encodings like UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, ASCII, CP1252, and more
- Repair broken characters due to mismatched encodings
- Help normalize text files for consistent display
- Prepare shellcode or exploits for specific platforms

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Usage

### Convert from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8:
```bash
iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 input.txt -o output.txt
```

### Convert and overwrite the same file:
```bash
iconv -f WINDOWS-1252 -t UTF-8 input.txt > temp && mv temp input.txt
```

| Option            | Description                                       |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `-f <from-enc>`   | Source encoding (e.g., `ISO-8859-1`, `UTF-16`)     |
| `-t <to-enc>`     | Target encoding (e.g., `UTF-8`, `ASCII//TRANSLIT`)|
| `-o <file>`       | Output file                                       |
| `--list`          | List all supported encodings                      |

## üß™ Examples

### Convert a Windows-encoded file to Unix UTF-8
```bash
iconv -f CP1252 -t UTF-8 file.txt -o utf8.txt
```

### Convert a binary hex dump to ASCII
```bash
cat hex.txt | xxd -r -p | iconv -f UTF-16LE -t UTF-8
```

### Transliterate unsupported characters (if possible)
```bash
iconv -f UTF-8 -t ASCII//TRANSLIT input.txt -o ascii.txt
```

### View available encodings
```bash
iconv --list
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Always double-check file encoding with `file` or `enca` before conversion.
- `ASCII//TRANSLIT` attempts to replace characters like `√©` with `e`.
- May be required when dealing with payloads on legacy systems or non-English targets.
