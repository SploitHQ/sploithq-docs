## üîç What can proxytunnel do?

- Bypass restrictive firewalls by tunneling over HTTP/HTTPS
- Connect to SSH servers behind proxy servers
- Work with HTTP and HTTPS proxy types
- Support basic proxy authentication
- Act as a backend for `ssh` or `telnet` tunneling

## üß™ Examples

### Tunnel an SSH connection through a proxy
```
proxytunnel -p 192.168.1.1:8080 -d ssh.example.com:22
```

### Tunnel SSH with proxy auth
```
proxytunnel -p proxy.example.com:8080 -d ssh.example.com:22 -u user -s pass
```

### Use proxytunnel with OpenSSH
```bash
ssh -o "ProxyCommand proxytunnel -p proxy.example.com:8080 -d %h:%p" user@ssh.example.com
```

### Add custom headers
```
proxytunnel -p proxy:8080 -d target.com:22 -H "X-Custom: Value"
```
