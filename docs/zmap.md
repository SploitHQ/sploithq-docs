# ZMap

**ZMap** is a high-speed network scanner designed for Internet-wide network surveys. It can scan the entire IPv4 address space in minutes from a single machine. Built for researchers and red teamers, ZMap is optimized for speed and scale ‚Äî not stealth.

## üîç What can ZMap do?

- Scan millions of IPs per second for open ports
- Perform stateless, single-packet scans
- Focus on one probe per IP (fast but not stealthy)
- Export to CSV or JSON for analysis
- Useful for Internet-wide research, vulnerability analysis, and threat hunting

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Usage

```bash
sudo zmap -p 80 0.0.0.0/0
```

Scans the entire IPv4 space for hosts with port 80 open.

| `-f <fields>`            | Fields to include in output (e.g. `saddr,sport,success`)      |
| `-oX`, `-oJ`, `-oC`      | Output as XML, JSON, or CSV                                   |
| `--whitelist-file`       | File with IPs/ranges to include                               |
| `--blacklist-file`       | File with IPs/ranges to exclude                               |
| `--bandwidth`            | Bandwidth limit (e.g. `10M`, `100M`)                          |
| `--probe-module`         | Scan module to use (`tcp_syn`, `icmp_echoscan`, etc.)         |

## üß™ Examples

### Scan port 443 on a /16 range
```bash
sudo zmap -p 443 192.168.0.0/16
```

### Scan full Internet for SSH (port 22) at 100kpps
```bash
sudo zmap -p 22 0.0.0.0/0 -r 100000
```

### Output to JSON with IP and success status
```bash
sudo zmap -p 80 10.0.0.0/8 -f saddr,success -oJ results.json
```

### Exclude private ranges with a blacklist
```bash
sudo zmap -p 80 0.0.0.0/0 --blacklist-file=/etc/zmap/blacklist.conf
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- **ZMap is extremely aggressive** ‚Äî do not scan targets without permission.
- Run as root to send raw packets.
- For internal scans, limit speed with `-r` or `--bandwidth` to avoid congestion.
- ZMap is best used for **reachability**, not deep fingerprinting.
