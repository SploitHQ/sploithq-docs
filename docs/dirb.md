# dirb

`dirb` is a command-line tool used for web content scanning. It is primarily used to find hidden directories and files on a web server by using a dictionary-based brute force method. It's a valuable tool for penetration testers and security researchers to uncover resources that might not be linked directly on a website but are accessible to those who know the paths.
