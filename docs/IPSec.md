# IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)

**IPsec** is a suite of protocols for securing IP communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet. It operates at the network layer and is widely used for VPNs, especially in enterprise and infrastructure-grade security solutions.

## üîç What can IPsec do?

- Secure communication over untrusted networks (e.g., the internet)
- Encrypt and authenticate IP packets between two hosts or gateways
- Support site-to-site and remote access VPNs
- Work in transport or tunnel mode
- Integrate with IKEv1 or IKEv2 for key exchange
- Compatible with most OS-level VPN clients (Linux, Windows, macOS, Android)

## ‚öôÔ∏è IPsec Modes

| Mode         | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Transport** | Encrypts only the payload of IP packets; commonly used for host-to-host VPNs |
| **Tunnel**    | Encrypts the entire IP packet; used for site-to-site or road warrior VPNs    |

## üß∞ Commonly Used Tools with IPsec

| Tool        | Description                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `strongSwan`| Popular open-source IPsec implementation (IKEv1/IKEv2) |
| `Libreswan` | Another robust IPsec implementation              |
| `ipsec`     | Front-end command provided by strongSwan or Libreswan |
| `racoon`    | Legacy IKE daemon (not commonly used today)      |
| `setkey`    | Manual SPD/SAD configuration (low-level, deprecated) |

## üß™ Example IPsec Setup with strongSwan

### ipsec.conf
```
conn myvpn
    keyexchange=ikev2
    left=%any
    leftid=@vpn.example.com
    leftcert=server-cert.pem
    leftsubnet=0.0.0.0/0
    right=%any
    rightauth=eap-mschapv2
    rightsourceip=10.0.0.0/24
    auto=add
```

### ipsec.secrets
```
: RSA server-key.pem
vpnuser : EAP "password123"
```

### Start and connect
```
sudo systemctl start strongswan
sudo ipsec up myvpn
```
