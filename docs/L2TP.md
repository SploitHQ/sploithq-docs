# L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)

**L2TP** is a VPN tunneling protocol used to encapsulate PPP frames over IP networks. It’s often combined with IPsec for encryption and is supported natively by many operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS.

## 🔍 What can L2TP do?

- Tunnel traffic between client and VPN server over UDP (usually port 1701)
- Combine with IPsec for encrypted VPN communication (L2TP/IPsec)
- Support username/password or certificate authentication
- Compatible with built-in VPN clients on most OS platforms
- Offer site-to-site and remote access configurations

> L2TP alone does **not** provide encryption. Use it with IPsec for secure VPNs.

## ⚙️ Basic Architecture

```
Client <---> L2TP Tunnel <---> VPN Server
         (Encapsulates PPP Frames)

+ IPsec Layer (Encrypts and authenticates packets)
```

L2TP/IPsec typically uses:
- UDP 500 for IKE (key exchange)
- UDP 4500 for NAT traversal
- UDP 1701 for the L2TP tunnel

## 🧰 Common Configuration Files (Linux)

| File                     | Purpose                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `/etc/ipsec.conf`        | IPsec connection definitions             |
| `/etc/ipsec.secrets`     | Pre-shared keys or certificates          |
| `/etc/xl2tpd/xl2tpd.conf`| L2TP tunnel configuration                |
| `/etc/ppp/options.xl2tpd`| PPP authentication settings              |

## 🧪 Example: Linux Setup with PSK

### `/etc/ipsec.conf`
```
conn L2TP-PSK
    keyexchange=ikev1
    authby=secret
    ike=aes256-sha1-modp1024
    esp=aes256-sha1
    left=%any
    leftprotoport=17/1701
    right=vpn.example.com
    rightprotoport=17/1701
    auto=add
```

### `/etc/ipsec.secrets`
```
%any vpn.example.com : PSK "your_shared_secret"
```

### `/etc/xl2tpd/xl2tpd.conf`
```
[lac vpn-connection]
lns = vpn.example.com
ppp debug = yes
pppoptfile = /etc/ppp/options.xl2tpd
length bit = yes
```

### `/etc/ppp/options.xl2tpd`
```
require-mschap-v2
refuse-pap
refuse-chap
refuse-mschap
name yourusername
password yourpassword
ipparam l2tpvpn
usepeerdns
```

### Start Services
```
sudo systemctl start strongswan
sudo systemctl start xl2tpd
```

### Connect Manually
```
echo "c vpn-connection" > /var/run/xl2tpd/l2tp-control
```
