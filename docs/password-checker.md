# Password Checker – Strength & Breach Validation Tool

The **Password Checker** on SploitHQ helps evaluate the strength, complexity, and safety of passwords. It provides instant feedback based on entropy, character class diversity, and known breaches — without storing or logging any data.

## 🔍 What Can the Password Checker Do?

- Analyze password strength (length, complexity, predictability)
- Estimate cracking time (offline and online attack scenarios)
- Compare against known leaked passwords (via HaveIBeenPwned or local lists)
- Encourage safer practices for password creation

## ⚙️ What Makes a Strong Password?

A strong password typically has:
- At least **12 characters**
- A mix of **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**
- No **dictionary words**, **common phrases**, or **keyboard patterns**
- No reuse from other sites or services

## 🧪 Examples of Strength Levels

| Password            | Length | Guess Time (Offline)     | Verdict         |
|---------------------|--------|---------------------------|------------------|
| `123456`            | 6      | Instant                   | ❌ Extremely Weak |
| `qwerty123`         | 9      | <1 second                 | ❌ Weak          |
| `Summer2024!`       | 11     | Hours (offline)           | ⚠️ Moderate      |
| `L!z&4uR3@bC2!`     | 13     | Decades (offline)         | ✅ Strong        |
| `Tr0ub4dor&3`       | 11     | ~3 days                   | ⚠️ Moderate      |

## 🧰 Best Practices

- Use a **password manager** to generate and store unique passwords
- Enable **multi-factor authentication** (MFA) wherever possible
- Regularly rotate passwords for sensitive systems
- Never reuse passwords across different services

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- The checker **does not transmit passwords** to the server.
- Hash comparisons (for breach checks) use **k-anonymity** or local hashing.
- For offline checks, integrate with local breach lists or use tools like `pwned` CLI.
